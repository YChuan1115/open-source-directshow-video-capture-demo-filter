simple demo "virtual camera" (fake camera) input.
originally from http://tmhare.mvps.org/downloads.htm

There is a "higher quality" dshow virtual inputter here:

https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free

It also doesn't handle paused graphs well/right yet.
in fillBuffer:
    // If graph is inactive stop cueing samples
    //if(!m_pParent->m_bActive || m_pParent->m_bEOF) 
    //    return S_FALSE;
